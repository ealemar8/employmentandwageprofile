# Employment and Wage Profile for Areas and Industries in Puerto Rico
This project is divided into two main components: 

1. A program that extracts multiple series of yearly data on wages, number of people employed and number of business establishments for all industries and municipalities at once from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages. This program extracts the data from the API of the Bureau of Labor Statistics and allows users to choose whether they want to download annual averages of the series or breakdowns by quarter. 

2. A dynamic dashboard that is fed by the aforementioned program. This tool allows users to see how the number of people employed, wages paid, and the number of business establishments have changed over the years in their municipality/industry of choice.
