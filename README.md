# employmentandwageprofile
This project is divided into two main components: 

1. A program that extracts multiple series of yearly data for all industries and all municipalities at once in long format.

2. A dynamic dashboard that is fed by the aforementioned program. This tool allows users to see how the number of people employed, wages paid, and the number of business establishments have 
changed over the years in their municipality/industry of choice.
